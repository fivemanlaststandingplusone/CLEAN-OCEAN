                            Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae of the order Sphenisciformes. 
                            They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: 
                            only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator.

                            Penguins are only found in the Southern Hemisphere. The greatest concentrations are on Antarctic coasts and sub-Antarctic islands. 
                            There are 18 species of penguins, 5 of which live in Antarctica. 
                            Another 4 species live on sub-Antarctic islands.

                    Penguins spend most of their lives in the water and are excellent swimmers. 
                    They have sleek, waterproof feathers, which lie flat against their bodies, letting them glide through the ocean. 
                    Because their bodies are designed to swim, they find it hard to move about on land, waddling slowly, while balancing with their wings. 
                    Penguins are also able to stand in an upright position and are able to travel long distances. 
                    Sometimes they also move by sliding along on their bellies!
